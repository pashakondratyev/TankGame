# TankGame

Period 3

This is a top down 2 player tank shooter game made with Java AWT and Swing libraries.
Compile and run Window.java to get it working.
Player 1 uses the arrow keys to move (left and right to rotate, forward and backward to go forward/backward)
and m to fire.
Player 2 uses WASD for movement and q for fire.
Hit the other tank with your bullet to win.
Makes uses of linked lists in order to add and store instances of the bullet class each time a tank fires as well as to store and cycle through the different maps each time the round restarts.

Known Bugs:
Bullet/Wall collision is buggy, particularly at some specific angles/directions. Shooting at certain angles will cause self-collision and instant death.
Spamming too many bullets will cause the program to crash.
